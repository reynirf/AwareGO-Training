**Inspiration**
Cybercrime is a real threat to everybody. Our team has an interest in cybersecurity and we want to educate others on the topic of cybercrime, which causes millions of dollars in damage every year.

*What it does**
Our app provides educational material on how to spot and deal with common cyber threats. We focus on real-life situations and learn-by-doing.

**How we built it**
We used Ionic, a cross-platform mobile app development framework, which made it possible to quickly develop an Android and iOS version of our app simultaneously.

**Challenges we ran into**
We had a lot of ideas. Our challenge was to narrow them down to be able to create a working prototype in 24 hours.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
We're proud to be able to showcase our idea within a scalable, progressive mobile app.

**What we learned**
We learned to value each other's strengths.

**What's next for AwareGO Training**
If we get acquired we have ambitions to implement other ideas.
